	"Nested class: Use it if your requirements are similar to those of a local class,
	you want to make the type more widely available, 
	and you don't require access to local variables or method parameters."
	
	Use a non-static nested class (or inner class) if you require access to 
	an enclosing instance's non-public fields and methods. 
	Use a static nested class if you don't require this access.
